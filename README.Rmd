# flowers

The goal of flowers is to provide a lodgepole pine flowering phenology dataset in an accessible format. This package contains 15 years of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) phenology data for pollen shed and cone receptivity. The data was collected in seed orchards in British Columbia and represents multiple BC provenances.

## Installation

<!--
You can install the released version of flowers from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("flowers")
```
-->

You can install the development version of flowers from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("scisus/flowers")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(flowers)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
